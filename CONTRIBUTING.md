## Lint, Style, Unit Tests

Just make sure `grunt` exits 0 before opening a Pull Request.

One caveat: Have a problem but don't know how to fix it? I welcome pull requests with new, failing unit tests.

## Squash?

I don't mind if you open a Pull Request with multiple commits, but, after review / updates, I'm going to ask you to squash before I merge.
